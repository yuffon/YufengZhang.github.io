# Welcome to Yufeng Zhang's Homepage

I am an associate professor in the College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University in Changsha, China.
My research interests are: program analysis, software reliability, and artificial intelligence.

I obtained my PhD at National University of Defense Technology. My PhD thesis is on the feasibility and scalability of symbolic execution.
Currently, I am researching on symbolic execution, fuzzing and deep learning.
